# Introduction to R Language Training
This is a 5-modules training I conceived and teached to my ex-colleagues (around 30 insurance folks) to introduce them to R language.
The structure of the training is the following

1. The Basics
2. Functions and Programming Blocks
3. Data Manipulation
4. Data Visualization
5. Data Modeling

There are also extra subjects sparsed in the modules, for example simulation techniques.
Examples and data are about insurance but the focus is on the language itself so the training can be easily followed by anyone.
The target audience is people who have never worked with R before.

The training is published as well in my blog [slow data](http://slow-data.com/category/r/).
All comments are welcomed.

Enjoy!
