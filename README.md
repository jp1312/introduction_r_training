# Introduction to R Language Training
This is a 5-modules training I conceived and taught to my ex-colleagues to introduce them to R language.
The structure is the following:

1. The Basics
2. Functions and Programming Blocks
3. Data Manipulation
4. Data Visualization
5. Data Modeling

Target audience is people who have never worked with R before so the training can be easily followed by anyone.
You can find it also in my blog [slow data](http://slow-data.com/category/r/).
All comments are welcomed.

Enjoy!
